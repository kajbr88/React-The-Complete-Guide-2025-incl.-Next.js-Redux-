# React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)

This repository contains the project files and code developed during the "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy.

## Course Description

This comprehensive course covers all aspects of modern React development, including core React & Typescript concepts, advanced features, Next.js for server-side rendering and full-stack applications, and Redux for state management. It provides a practical, hands-on approach to building robust and scalable React applications.

## Course Content
The course is structured into modules, covering topics such as:

* A thorough introduction to React.js (What is it and why would you use it?)
* All the core basics: How React works, building components with React & building UIs with React
* Components, props & dynamic data binding
* Working with user events and state to create interactive applications
* A (thorough) look behind the scenes to understand how React works under the hood
* Detailed explanations on how to work with lists and conditional content
* React Hooks (in-depth)
* Working with built-in Hooks and building custom Hooks
* How to debug React apps
* Styling React apps with "Styled Components" and "CSS Modules"
* Working with "Fragments" & "Portals"
* Dealing with side effects
* Class-based components and functional components
* Sending Http requests & handling transitional states + responses
* Handling forms and user input (incl. validation)
* Using React Form Actions
* Redux & Redux Toolkit
* Routing with React Router
* Understanding React Server Components
* An in-depth introduction into Next.js
* Deploying React Apps
* Implementing Authentication
* Unit Tests
* Combining React with TypeScript
* Adding Animations
* Tons of examples and demo projects so that you can apply all the things you learned in real projects
* And so much more - check out the full curriculum on Udemy.

## Notes

* **Some projects may not run or throw errors when in deeply nested folders when using Windows OS, because of Windows OS's Long Path issue/limitation, in such case copy the project to drive C, D etc, and into a single nested folder and if the project still throws errors then try to shorten the folder names where the project is copied to one or two word names and also without any spaces or with '-' and '_' instead of spaces.** 
* Each project directory contains the complete React, Javascript, Typescript or Next.js project files for that particular application.
* Each project directory contains the final/completed project for the particular module named "starting project" or so, as i had cloned the instructors starting project for each module and worked on that alongside instructor and completed the particular modules project on the same starting project. Step-by-step lesson wise example can be found inside "Full-Module-Resources" folder. 
* This repository is intended for personal use and learning purposes.

## How to Run the Projects

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3.  Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.
4.  Run `npm run dev`/'npm start' (or `yarn start`/`yarn dev`) to launch the application.
5.  Some project use Express.js and Node.js backend hence, you need to start the backend as well, backend project can be found next to the frontend folder so just `cd backend'.
6.  Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install backend dependencies.
7.  Run `npm run dev`/'npm start' (or `yarn start`/'yarn dev`) to launch the application.
